What are we solving?

How are we solving it?
So basically, we are creating a heart moniter to reduce the time it takes for nurses to check up on patients. It reads BPM, blood oxygyn, and the temp. So basically the sensors send data to back end and back end goes into mySQL and then it pipelines to the front end where we display patient's data for nurses and doctors to use.
