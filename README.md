What are we solving?


How are we solving it?
We are creating a heart monitor to reduce the time it takes for nurses to check up on patients. It reads BPM, blood oxygen, and the temp. The sensors send data to the back-end and back-end goes into MySQL and then it pipelines to the front end where we display patient data for nurses and doctors to use.
