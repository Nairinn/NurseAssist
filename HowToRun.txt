### Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting Up Flask and Sensors on Raspberry Pi

1. **Update Your Raspberry Pi:**
   Open the terminal and run the following commands to update your package list and upgrade installed packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Install the necessary libraries for Flask and the sensors:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   pip3 install Flask adafruit-circuitpython-max30102 adafruit-circuitpython-ds18x20 adafruit-circuitpython-busio
   ```

3. **Set Up One-Wire Temperature Sensor:**
   Enable the One-Wire interface:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
   Navigate to **Interfacing Options > 1-Wire > Enable**.

4. **Create Your Project Directory:**
   Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/sensor_project
   cd ~/sensor_project
   ```

5. **Run Your Flask App:**
   In the terminal, run your Flask application:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
   Your app will now be running, and you can access it via `http://<your-raspberry-pi-ip>:5000/sensor-data`.

6. **Test Your Setup:**
   Open a web browser or use `curl` to check if your Flask app is returning sensor data:
   ```bash
   curl http://<your-raspberry-pi-ip>:5000/sensor-data
   ```

7. **Access the Data in Frontend:**
   Now that your backend is running, you can create a React frontend that makes HTTP GET requests to the `/sensor-data` endpoint to display the sensor readings.
