Connecting Sensors to Raspberry Pi So I don't forget lol 

1. Wiring the Sensors

   HiLetgo MAX30102 (Heart Rate Sensor):
   - GND (Ground) -> Connect to any ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
   - VCC (Power) -> Connect to the 3.3V or 5V pin (depending on the sensor's operating voltage).
   - SCL (Clock Line) -> Connect to GPIO3 (Pin 5) on the Raspberry Pi.
   - SDA (Data Line) -> Connect to GPIO2 (Pin 3) on the Raspberry Pi.

   BOJACK DS18B20 (Temperature Sensor):
   - GND (Ground) -> Connect to any ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
   - VCC (Power) -> Connect to the 3.3V pin.
   - DQ (Data) -> Connect to GPIO4 (Pin 7) on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Resistor -> Place a 4.7kÎ© resistor between the VCC and DQ (data) line.

2. Enabling I2C for the MAX30102:
   To use the MAX30102 heart rate sensor, enable I2C communication on the Raspberry Pi:
   - Open the terminal and run:
     sudo raspi-config
   - Go to Interfacing Options, then select I2C, and enable it.
   - Install I2C tools:
     sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
     sudo i2cdetect -y 1

3. Enable 1-Wire Interface for DS18B20:
   - Open the terminal and run:
     sudo raspi-config
   - Select Interfacing Options and enable 1-Wire.
   - Verify DS18B20 sensor is detected:
     ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
     You should see a folder that starts with 28-, which indicates your sensor is connected.

4. Reading Data in Python:
   For MAX30102:
   - Install the required library:
     pip install max30102
   - Use Python to read sensor data.

   For DS18B20:
   - Use the w1thermsensor library:
     pip install w1thermsensor
   - Access the temperature sensor data in Python.
